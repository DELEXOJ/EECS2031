mainA= 1
mainB= 20000
x=1
y=20000
mainA= No symbol "mainA" in current context. 
The reason is because mainA is not defined in the swap method
mainB=No symbol "mainB" in current context
The reason is because mainA is not defined in the swap method
x=20000
y=1
Are x and y swap? Yes
mainA=1
mainB=20000
Are mainA and mainB swap? NO because we used pass by value in the main function
so it does not affect the value of mainA and mainB.
x=No symbol "x" in current context
The reason is because x is not defined in the main method
y=No symbol "y" in current context
The reason is because y is not defined in the main method
